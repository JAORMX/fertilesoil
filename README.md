Fertile Soil
===========

It's what needed for healthy trees to grow in.

Fertile Soil is a framework to build platforms with. It builds upon the concept
of a tree (a directory structure) which is the basis of a multi-tenant platform.

It provides a tree representation, as well as the backend to store it in a
database. It also provides an HTTP API to access the tree.
